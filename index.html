    <div class="abstract">
      The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent
      or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder.
      The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an
      attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the
      Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with
      recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine
      translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being
      more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our
      model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation
      task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by
      over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model
      establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after
      training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training
      costs of the best models from the literature.

    <h2>1 Introduction</h2>
    <div class="content">
      Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory <sup>[12]</sup> and
      gated recurrent <sup>[7]</sup> neural networks in particular, have been
      firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and
      transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation
      <sup>[29,2,5]</sup>. Numerous efforts have since continued to push the
      boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures
      <sup>[31,21,13]</sup>.

        * Equal contribution. Listing order is random. Jakob proposed replacing
        RNNs with self-attention and started the effort to evaluate this idea.
        Ashish, with Illia, designed and implemented the first Transformer
        models and has been crucially involved in every aspect of this work.
        Noam proposed scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention and the
        attention-free position representations and became the other person
        involved in nearly every detail. Niki designed, implemented, tuned and
        evaluated countless model variants in our original codebase and
        tensor2tensor. Llion also experimented with novel model variants, was
        responsible for our initial codebase, and efficient inference and
        visualizations. Lukasz and Aidan spent countless long days designing
        various parts of and implementing tensor2tensor, replacing our earlier
        codebase, greatly improving results and massively accelerating our
        research.
