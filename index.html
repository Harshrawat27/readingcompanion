      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent
        or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder.
        The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through
        an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture,
        the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with
        recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine
        translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while
        being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to
        train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German
        translation task, improving over the existing best results, including
        ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation
        task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU
        score of 41.0 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small
        fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.

    <h2>1 Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory <sup>[12]</sup> and
      gated recurrent <sup>[7]</sup> neural networks in particular, have been
      firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and
      transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation
      <sup>[29, 2, 5]</sup>. Numerous efforts have since continued to push the
      boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures
      <sup>[31, 21, 13]</sup>.

        * Equal contribution. Listing order is random. Jakob proposed replacing
        RNNs with self-attention and started the effort to evaluate this idea.
        Ashish, with Illia, designed and implemented the first Transformer
        models and has been crucially involved in every aspect of this work.
        Noam proposed scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention and the
        parameter-free position representation and became the other person
        involved in nearly every detail. Niki designed, implemented, tuned and
        evaluated countless model variants in our original codebase and
        tensor2tensor. Llion also experimented with novel model variants, was
        responsible for our initial codebase, and efficient inference and
        visualizations. Lukasz and Aidan spent countless long days designing
        various parts of and implementing tensor2tensor, replacing our earlier
        codebase, greatly improving results and massively accelerating our
        research.
